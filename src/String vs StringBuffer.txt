	The String class is immutable.			
	
	The StringBuffer class is mutable.
	
	String is slow and consumes more memory when we concatenate too many strings because every time it creates new instance.

	StringBuffer is fast and consumes less memory when we concatenate the strings.
	
	String class overrides the equals()method of Object class. So you can compare the contents of two strings by equals() method.	

	StringBuffer class doesn't override the equals() method of Object class.

	String class is slower while performing concatenation operation.	
	
	StringBuffer class is faster while performing concatenation operation.
	
	String class uses String constant pool.	
	
	StringBuffer uses Heap memory
