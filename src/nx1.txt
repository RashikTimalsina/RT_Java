 Loop:
	It is used to iterate or repeat statements till the condition is true.
	There are three types of loop
		for loop		Ex:    to print HelloWorld for fixed number of times i.e 10 times,50 times etc.
		while loop	                 Ex:    to check the condition first & if true then print Hello World until condition becomes false
		do while loop	Ex:     to print Hello World first and then check the condition is true/false

For loop:
	SYNTAX:
		for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement)		//this loop is used when times to iterate is known
		{
			statements; 		//{System.out.println()} and with return values we dont give curly braces
		} 


While Loop
		initialization; 	//this loop is used to iterate when we dont know for how much time we have to iterate value
		while(condition)				//first checks condition and executes code
		{
			statements;
			increment/decrement;
		}

do while loop:
		initialization;
		do
		{
			statements;			//first executes code then check condition
			increment/decrement;
		}while(condition);
