
WRAPPER CLASS  = 
		 provides a way to use primitive data types as reference data types
          	                	reference data types contain useful methods
                               	can be used with collections (ex.ArrayList)

    PRIMITIVE            WRAPPER
    //-----------            //  -----------
    // boolean             //Boolean
    //char                   //Character
    //int                      //Integer
    //double               //Double
    //string                 //String


   AUTOBOXING = 
		the automatic conversion that the Java Compiler makes between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrappers

    UNBOXING = 
		Automatic conversion of wrapper class to primitive class
