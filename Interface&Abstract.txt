
Interface:
                 It is used for multiple inheritance. 
                 It doesn't allow to create object of it.
                 It uses "implements" keyword.
                 It doesn't allow to give body part of function.
  

Abstract class: 
                 It doesn't allow to create object of it.
                 It uses "extends" keyword.
                 It doesn't allow to give body part of function.
                 For abstract class, it must have abstract function.
                 
                 Eg; abstract class ABC
                        {
                             public abstract void demo()      
                        }
